## 📌 Overview

This project presents a **robust toxic comment detection system** designed to identify harmful or abusive language in user-generated content on online platforms. By leveraging **high-dimensional linguistic features** and **a wide spectrum of machine learning models**, our approach addresses two major challenges in this domain:

* **Class imbalance**: Toxic comments are significantly underrepresented in most real-world datasets.
* **Short-text classification**: Many toxic inputs lack contextual depth, making accurate classification more complex.

The system integrates **classical, ensemble, and deep learning models**, providing a comparative study that helps balance **precision and recall**, minimizing both **over-censorship** and **false negatives**.

## 📊 Dataset

* **Source**: Kaggle (Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge)
* **Size**: 159,571 total comments
* **Labeled Subset**: 1,000 manually annotated comments used for in-depth evaluation
* **Imbalance Note**: Toxic comments represent a small minority, reflecting real-world distribution.

## 🧱 Methodology

### 🔍 Feature Engineering

Each comment is represented by a **high-dimensional feature vector**:

$$
\mathbf{f}_i = \left[ \mathbf{e}_i, \mathbf{l}_i, \mathbf{p}_i, \mathbf{d}_i \right]
$$

Where:

* $\mathbf{e}_i$: BERT-based word embeddings
* $\mathbf{l}_i$: Lexicon-based toxicity and sentiment scores
* $\mathbf{p}_i$: One-hot encoded part-of-speech (POS) tags
* $\mathbf{d}_i$: Dependency parse features extracted from syntactic structures

All features are normalized to ensure compatibility across heterogeneous representations.

### 🧠 Models Evaluated

| Category      | Models                                       |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Classical     | Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Linear SVM |
| Ensemble      | Random Forest, XGBoost                       |
| Deep Learning | LSTM, Extended LSTM (xLSTM), BERT variants   |

Each model was trained on the extracted features using weighted binary cross-entropy to emphasize toxic labels.

## ⚙️ Training & Evaluation

### ✅ Loss Function

Custom weighted binary cross-entropy loss:

$$
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N w_i \left[ y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1-y_i) \log(1-\hat{y}_i) \right]
$$

* $w_i$ adjusted to prioritize toxic class
* $\hat{y}_i$: predicted probability
* $y_i$: ground truth

### 📈 Metrics Used

* **Recall**: Prioritizing detection of harmful content
* **Precision**: Avoiding over-censorship of benign content
* **F1-Score**: Balance between recall and precision
* **Confusion Matrix**: For error analysis

## 📊 Key Results

| Model               | Recall | F1-Score | FN (missed toxic) | FP (false toxic) |
| ------------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Logistic Regression | 0.48   | 0.48     | 358               | 702              |
| Linear SVM (SGD)    | 0.37   | 0.39     | 322               | 695              |
| Random Forest       | 0.43   | 0.42     | 1127              | 702              |
| XGBoost             | 0.42   | 0.42     | **1337**          | **82**           |

* **Linear SVM** is a strong baseline with balanced performance.
* **XGBoost** has high precision but low recall, missing many toxic cases.
* Deep models like **xLSTM** and **BERT** (in extended work) showed improved generalization but require more resources.

## 📉 Learning Curve Insights

* **XGBoost** shows the best generalization performance.
* **Random Forest** overfits the training data.
* **SVM** underfits, but with stable learning behavior.
* **BERT-based transformers** (future integration) promise enhanced context understanding.
